                <h2>Information about known Freshwater Fishes</h2>
                <p>Tench: The tench or doctor fish (Tinca tinca) is a fresh- and brackish-water fish of the cyprinid family found throughout Eurasia from Western Europe including the British Isles east into Asia as far as the Ob and Yenisei Rivers.[2] It is also found in Lake Baikal.[citation needed] It normally inhabits slow-moving freshwater habitats, particularly lakes and lowland rivers.[3][4] In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the tench is called Schlei.

                <p>Salmon: Salmon /ˈsæmən/ is the common name for several species of ray-finned fish in the family Salmonidae. Other fish in the same family include trout, char, grayling and whitefish. Salmon are native to tributaries of the North Atlantic (genus Salmo) and Pacific Ocean (genus Oncorhynchus). Many species of salmon have been introduced into non-native environments such as the Great Lakes of North America and Patagonia in South America. Salmon are intensively farmed in many parts of the world.
                Typically, salmon are anadromous: they hatch in fresh water, migrate to the ocean, then return to fresh water to reproduce. However, populations of several species are restricted to fresh water through their lives. Folklore has it that the fish return to the exact spot where they hatched to spawn. Tracking studies have shown this to be mostly true. A portion of a returning salmon run may stray and spawn in different freshwater systems; the percent of straying depends on the species of salmon.[1] Homing behavior has been shown to depend on olfactory memory.[2][3] Salmon date back to the Neogene.

                <h2>Where you can find Freshwater fishes</h2>
                <p>Freshwater fish are those that spend some or all of their lives in fresh water, such as rivers and lakes, with a salinity of less than 1.05%. These environments differ from marine conditions in many ways, the most obvious being the difference in levels of salinity. To survive fresh water, the fish need a range of physiological adaptations.
                41.24% of all known species of fish are found in fresh water. This is primarily due to the rapid speciation that the scattered habitats make possible. When dealing with ponds and lakes, one might use the same basic models of speciation as when studying island biogeography. Fish can respond to environmental changes thus they can indicate pollution.[1] Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshwater_fish" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshwater_fish</a></p>
