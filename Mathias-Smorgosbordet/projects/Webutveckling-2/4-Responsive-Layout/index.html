                <h1>Yakuza 0 Judgement -shinpan- Lyrics:<br>
                    I am a useless, no-good stray dog<br>

                    That's broken off straight from the rails<br>
                    
                    But I won't wag my goddamn tail<br>
                    
                    For no reason at all to you<br>
                    
                    I missed my chance to be a good old yes-man<br>
                    
                    (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, we are bad boys)<br>
                    
                    Written on the wall by the youth is a "no", known as Justice<br>
                    
                    
                    Wow, breakin' the law<br>
                    
                    Breakin' the world, destroy it!<br>
                    
                    Tear apart the tenderness!<br>
                    
                    Wow, breakin' the rule<br>
                    
                    We won't be bound by any of the Six Codes (breakin' the law)<br>
                    
                    We're rising up again!<br>
                    
                    Our fists are raised, our minds are boiling<br>
                    
                    So call it our way of Judgement!<br>
                    
                    
                    I've never ever even known love<br>
                    
                    The lowly, foolish mutt that I am inside<br>
                    
                    But they can't tame and fucking feed me<br>
                    
                    With their dough, or social standing shit<br>
                    
                    
                    It may hurt like hell, it may hurt like hell<br>
                    
                    Even if I lose all I've ever known<br>
                    
                    You won't corrupt me, no, and that will bring you your Justice.... Justice!<br>
                    
                    
                    Wow, breakin' the law<br>
                    
                    Breakin' the world, destroy it!<br>
                    
                    Tear apart the tenderness!<br>
                    
                    Wow, breakin' the rule<br>
                    
                    We won't warm up, won't suck up to the big names (breakin' the law)<br>
                    
                    We're rising up again!<br>
                    
                    Hold high your fists, your angry fists, and we'll give out our own, yeah<br>
                    
                    We'll all give out our own Judgement... Judgement!<br></h1>
